        <h1 id="what-can-you-do-to-get-better-sleep">What can you do to get better sleep?</h1><ol>
<li><strong>Reduce Caffeine</strong> &amp; Nicotine</li>
<li><strong>Reduce alcohol</strong> - Ideally stop.</li>
<li><strong>Remove screens</strong> from the bedroom, or stop using any screen at least 1-2 hours before sleep. Also turn on night filter just after sundown.</li>
<li><strong>Lower temperature</strong> of bedroom - 17-18° on AC is ideal</li>
<li><strong>Regularise</strong> bed and wake-up time - Irrespective of whether it is the weekend or a weekday. Even if you’ve had a bad night of sleep, still wake up at the same time of day and reset.</li>
<li>Go to bed <strong>only when sleepy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never lie awake</strong> in bed — get up and do stuff: If you’re in bed for more than 20 mins. Get up.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid daytime napping</strong> - If absolutely necessary then try to keep it before 3 in the afternoon, post that, sleeping in the night is hindered.</li>
<li>Mentally <strong>Decelerate before bedtime</strong> - Relax before bed. Don’t overschedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding. A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.
remove visible clockfaces from your view</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong> is great, but not too late in the day as body temperature can remain high leading to worse sleep. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.</li>
<li>Have the right <strong>sunlight exposure</strong>. Daylight is key to regulating daily sleep patterns. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day. If possible, wake up with the sun or use very bright lights in the morning.</li>
<li>Take a <strong>hot bath</strong> before bed, alternatively you can wash your face with cold water also</li>
</ol><h3 id="nasa-nap-culture">NASA nap culture</h3><p>They discovered that naps as short as 26 minutes in length still offered a 34% improvement in task performance and more than 50% increase in overall alertness. These results hatched the so-called NASA nap culture.</p><h2 id="in-society">In Society</h2><p>The World Health Organization recognizes lack of sleep as a global health epidemic. The brain can never recover all the sleep it has been deprived of. We cannot accumulate a sleep debt throughout the week and catch up on the weekends.</p><h3 id="business">Business</h3><p>Routinely, business leaders mistakenly believe that time on-task equates with task completion and productivity. A study across four large US companies found that insufficient sleep cost almost $2,000 per employee per year in lost productivity. Insufficient sleep robs most nations of more than 2 percent of their GDP.</p><p>Creativity, intelligence, motivation, effort, efficiency, effectiveness when working in groups, as well as emotional stability, sociability, and honesty. All of these things are systematically dismantled by insufficient sleep. Sleep-deprived individuals also generate fewer and less accurate solutions to work-relevant problems they are challenged with. People are much more likely to lie, cheat, steal, and blame others for their mistakes when then sleep six or less hours.</p><h3 id="education">Education</h3><p>Teenagers in America routinely wake up at 5:30, or earlier, to get to class—this is crazy. Adolescence is the most susceptible phase of life for developing chronic mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and suicidality. Sleep deprivation can be the tipping point between psychological wellness and lifelong psychiatric illness. Increasing sleep by way of delayed school start times wonderfully increases class attendance, reduces behavioral and psychological problems, and decreases substance and alcohol use.</p><p>It’s estimated that more than 50% of all children with an ADHD diagnosis actually have a sleep disorder.</p><h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3><p>Throughout the course of their residency, one in five medical residents will make a sleepless-related medical error that causes significant, liable harm to a patient. One in twenty will kill a patient due to a lack of sleep. Medical errors are the third-leading cause of death among Americans after heart attacks and cancer. Sleeplessness undoubtedly plays a role in those lives lost.</p><p>If you are about to undergo an elective surgery, you should ask how much sleep your doctor as had.
One cannot “learn” how to overcome a lack of sleep and develop resilience.</p><h3 id="ideas">Ideas</h3><ul>
<li>Link individual sleep trackers with connected devices like thermostats and lighting.</li>
<li>We need to increase sleep awareness and teach it in our schools.</li>
<li>Companies could incentivize their employees to get better sleep.</li>
<li>Business should offer more flexibility with their work hours. Allowing larks to start early and owls to stay late.</li>
<li>Health insurance costs could go down if people were rewarded to prioritize sleep.</li>
</ul><h1 id="optimisations">Optimisations</h1><ul>
<li>In any given timezone, people in the EAST will on an average receive more sleep</li>
<li>While changing timezones, its easier to go west than go east. Every hour of lost sleep takes one day to make it up</li>
<li>Don’t drink coffee after 12 in the afternoon. Limit that too</li>
<li>Don’t nap after 3 in the afternoon</li>
<li>Ideally For an average person: 11-7AM (8 hrs) &amp; 12PM-1PM (30-40 mins)</li>
