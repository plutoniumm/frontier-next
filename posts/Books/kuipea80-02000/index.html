        <p>Hannah Arendt, a Jew who fled Germany during Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, for The New Yorker. A revised and enlarged edition was published in 1964.</p><h2 id="conclusions-on-eichmann">Conclusions on Eichmann</h2><p>Eichmann stated himself in court that he had always tried to abide by Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative (as discussed directly on pp. 135–137). She argues that Eichmann had essentially taken the wrong lesson from Kant: Eichmann had not recognized the “golden rule” and principle of reciprocity implicit in the categorical imperative, but had understood only the concept of one man’s actions coinciding with general law. Eichmann attempted to follow the spirit of the laws he carried out, as if the legislator himself would approve. In Kant’s formulation of the categorical imperative, the legislator is the moral self, and all people are legislators; in Eichmann’s formulation, the legislator was Hitler. Eichmann claimed this changed when he was charged with carrying out the Final Solution, at which point Arendt claims “he had ceased to live according to Kantian principles, that he had known it, and that he had consoled himself with the thoughts that he no longer ‘was master of his own deeds,’ that he was unable ‘to change anything’” (p. 136).</p><p>Eichmann’s inability to think for himself was exemplified by his consistent use of “stock phrases and self-invented clichés”. The man demonstrated his unrealistic worldview and crippling lack of communication skills through reliance on “officialese” (Amtssprache) and the euphemistic Sprachregelung (convention of speech) that made implementation of Hitler’s policies “somehow palatable”. It has often been mentioned over and over that as long as Eichmann had these stock phrases to come up with he could keep going on with the trial.</p><p>While Eichmann might have had anti-Semitic leanings, Arendt argued that he showed “no case of insane hatred of Jews, of fanatical anti-Semitism or indoctrination of any kind. He personally never had anything whatever against Jews” (p. 26). It is also possible that this is attributed to his own Stock Phrases and Cliches that he was able to moderate down something that was actually far more sinister in nature.</p><p>Eichmann was a “joiner” his entire life, in that he constantly joined organizations in order to define himself, and had difficulties thinking for himself without doing so. As a youth, he belonged to the YMCA, the Wandervogel, and the Jungfrontkämpferverband. In 1933, he failed in his attempt to join the Schlaraffia (a men’s organization similar to Freemasonry), at which point a family friend (and future war criminal) Ernst Kaltenbrunner encouraged him to join the SS. At the end of World War II, Eichmann found himself depressed because “it then dawned on him that thenceforward he would have to live without being a member of something or other” (pp. 32–3). Arendt pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a joiner. In his own words:</p><blockquote>
<p>I sensed I would have to live a leaderless and difficult individual life, I would receive no directives from anybody, no orders and commands would any longer be issued to me, no pertinent ordinances would be there to consult—in brief, a life never known before lay ahead of me.</p>
</blockquote><p>Despite his claims, Eichmann was not, in fact, very intelligent. Arendt goes on to support this with instances of his performance history. Arendt however also confirms Eichmann and the heads of the Einsatzgruppen were part of an “intellectual elite.” Unlike the Einsatzgruppen leaders, however, Eichmann would suffer from a “lack of imagination” and an “inability to think.”</p><p>Arendt confirms several points where Eichmann actually claimed he was responsible for certain atrocities, even though he lacked the power and/or expertise to take these actions. Moreover, Eichmann made these claims even though they hurt his defense, hence Arendt’s remark that “Bragging was the vice that was Eichmann’s undoing” (p. 46). Arendt also suggests that Eichmann may have preferred to be executed as a war criminal than live as a nobody. This parallels his overestimation of his own intelligence and his past value in the organizations in which he had served, as stated above. This bragging did not only go on in court but also in Argentina where he was kidnapped from.</p><p>Arendt argues that Eichmann, in his peripheral role at the Wannsee Conference, witnessed the rank-and-file of the German civil service heartily endorse Reinhard Heydrich’s program for the Final Solution of the Jewish question in Europe (German: die Endlösung der Judenfrage). Upon seeing members of “respectable society” endorsing mass murder, and enthusiastically participating in the planning of the solution, Eichmann felt that his moral responsibility was relaxed, as if he were “Pontius Pilate”.</p><p>During his imprisonment before his trial, the Israeli government sent no fewer than six psychologists to examine Eichmann. These psychologists found no trace of mental illness, including personality disorder. One doctor remarked that his overall attitude towards other people, especially his family and friends, was “highly desirable”, while another remarked that the only unusual trait Eichmann displayed was being more “normal” in his habits and speech than the average person (pp. 25–6). <strong>This later went on to futhur complicate the analysis of the extent of evil in his intentions since this implied he was neither indifferent to suffering nor did he have any particular hatred for the jews</strong></p><h2 id="fundamental-attribution-error">Fundamental Attribution Error..?</h2><p>Like along similar lines even from Chris Browning’s Ordinary Men, Arendt suggests that this most strikingly discredits the idea that the Nazi criminals were manifestly psychopathic and different from “normal” people. From this document, many concluded that situations such as the Holocaust can make even the most ordinary of people commit horrendous crimes with the proper incentives, but Arendt adamantly disagreed with this interpretation, as Eichmann was voluntarily following the Führerprinzip. Arendt insists that moral choice remains even under totalitarianism, and that this choice has political consequences even when the chooser is politically powerless:</p><blockquote>
<p>Under conditions of terror most people will comply but some people will not, just as the lesson of the countries to which the Final Solution was proposed is that “it could happen” in most places but it did not happen everywhere. Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a place fit for human habitation.</p>
</blockquote><p>Arendt mentions, as a case in point, <em>Denmark</em>:</p><blockquote>
<p>One is tempted to recommend the story as required reading in political science for all students who wish to learn something about the enormous power potential inherent in non-violent action and in resistance to an opponent possessing vastly superior means of violence. It was not just that the people of Denmark refused to assist in implementing the Final Solution, as the peoples of so many other conquered nations had been persuaded to do (or had been eager to do) — but also, that when the Reich cracked down and decided to do the job itself it found that its own personnel in Denmark had been infected by this and were unable to overcome their human aversion with the appropriate ruthlessness, as their peers in more cooperative areas had.</p>
</blockquote><p>On Eichmann’s personality, Arendt concludes:</p><blockquote>
<p>Despite all the efforts of the prosecution, everybody could see that this man was not a “monster,” but it was difficult indeed not to suspect that he was a clown. And since this suspicion would have been fatal to the entire enterprise [his trial], and was also rather hard to sustain in view of the sufferings he and his like had caused to millions of people, his worst clowneries were hardly noticed and almost never reported (p. 55).</p>
</blockquote><p>Arendt ended the book by writing:</p><blockquote>
<p>And just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.</p>
</blockquote><p><em>Commentary</em>: This is in a way in of in line with my personal thought of the world war in general. Why should the Nazi regime be taught to students? Because they killed 6M people? No Mao killed 40M, Stalin 20M. Because the decided to take over the world? No Genghis Khan and the British were far larger. BUT. Because they decided to become gods. At no point ever in history has someone decided to exterminate a whole section of society on grounds of Biological Superiority. There has always been CLAIMED moral superiority (Indian Class System) or say Lifestyle Superiority (American Slavery) but never Biological, and at such a scale. The truth however at least so far is that on all counts, The Jewish people have proven to be statistically the very opposite if so, on grounds of Most Nobel Prize Wins, or the most successful family Financially (Rothschilds) etc in stark contrast to whatever hitler thought in any sense.</p><h2 id="conviction">Conviction</h2><p>Beyond her discussion of Eichmann himself, Arendt discusses several additional aspects of the trial, its context, and the Holocaust.</p><p>She points out that Eichmann was kidnapped by Israeli agents in Argentina and transported to Israel, an illegal act, and that he was tried in Israel even though he was not accused of committing any crimes there. “If he had not been found guilty before he appeared in Jerusalem, guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, the Israelis would never have dared, or wanted, to kidnap him in formal violation of Argentine law.”</p><p>She describes his trial as a show trial arranged and managed by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, and says that Ben-Gurion wanted, for several political reasons, to emphasize not primarily what Eichmann had done, but what the Jews had suffered during the Holocaust.[3] She points out that the war criminals tried at Nuremberg were “indicted for crimes against the members of various nations,” without special reference to the Nazi genocide against the Jews.</p><p>She questions Israel’s right to try Eichmann. Israel was a signatory to the 1950 UN Genocide Convention, which rejected universal jurisdiction and required that defendants be tried ‘in the territory of which the act was committed’ or by an international tribunal. The court in Jerusalem did not pursue either option.
Eichmann’s deeds were not crimes under German law, as at that time, in the eyes of the Third Reich, he was a law-abiding citizen. He was tried for ‘crimes in retrospect’.</p><p>The prosecutor, Gideon Hausner, followed the tone set by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, who stated, ‘It is not an individual nor the Nazi regime on trial, but Antisemitism throughout history.’ Hausner’s corresponding opening statements, which heavily referenced biblical passages, was ‘bad history and cheap rhetoric,’ according to Arendt. Furthermore, it suggested that Eichmann was no criminal, but the ‘innocent executor of some foreordained destiny.’</p><h2 id="charges">Charges</h2><p>Counts 1–4 were for crimes against the Jewish people:</p><ul>
<li>Killing Jews, via the systematic deportation of millions of Jews to the extermination camps beginning in August 1941</li>
<li>Placing Jews in living conditions calculated to bring about their physical destruction, by imprisoning them in concentration and extermination camps</li>
<li>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to Jews[14]</li>
<li>Preventing births against Jews, with an order for forced abortions in Theresienstadt Ghetto</li>
</ul><p>Counts 5–7 were for crimes against humanity against Jews</p><ul>
<li>Forced emigration of Jews from March 1938 to October 1941, deportation of Jews in October 1939 during the Nisko Plan, and his role in the Final Solution</li>
<li>Persecuting Jews on national, religious, or political grounds</li>
<li>The systematic plunder of the property of millions of Jews. Theft of property was not enumerated in the law as a crime against humanity (it was counted as a war crime), but the prosecution argued that it fit the criteria of “any other inhuman act committed against any civilian population” as stipulated in the law. Since Eichmann founded the Central Office for Jewish Emigration, which confiscated the property of deported Jews, and the court determined that the purpose of such confiscation was in part to instill terror and facilitate the deportation and murder of Jews, it found him guilty on this count.</li>
<li>Count 8 was for war crimes, based on Eichmann’s role in the systematic persecution and murder of Jews during World War II.</li>
</ul><p>Counts 9–12 related to crimes against humanity against non-Jews:</p><ul>
<li>Mass deportations of Polish civilians</li>
<li>Mass deportations of Slovene civilians</li>
<li>Participation in the Romani genocide by the systematic forced deportation of Romani people. Although the court did not find evidence that Eichmann knew that the Romani victims were sent to extermination camps, it nevertheless found him guilty on that count.</li>
<li>Participation in the Lidice massacre; he was found guilty for deportation of part of the population of Lidice, but not the massacre itself.</li>
</ul><p>Counts 13–15 charged Eichmann with</p><ul>
<li>Membership in enemy organizations, respectively the Schutzstaffeln der NSDAP (SS), Sicherheitsdienst der Reichfuehrers SS (SD), and Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo). He was found guilty on all three counts because he was not only proven to be a member of these organizations but committed crimes as part of his role, namely those discussed above.</li>
</ul><p>Otto Adolf Eichamnn, member of the Athiest Nazi Regime, who orchestrated the death of millions of Jews was executed by them on the Holiest Land on the planet, Jerusalem. Found guilty on all 15 counts and sentenced to death.</p>
