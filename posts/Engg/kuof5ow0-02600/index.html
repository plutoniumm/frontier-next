        <p>Timber buildings it seems are making a comeback after very long. While most buildings are made up of concrete and steel, for very small buildings, there is no need to use them, in such cases wood is good enough so long as it passes some basic tests of strength and safety.</p><h2 id="carbon">Carbon</h2><p>An average 10 storey building made from wood as opposed to concrete and steel (C&amp;S) would save around 1400 tons of CO2. The advantage of wood is that first it takes about 20% of the weight of material it takes to build a short wood building than it wood take C&amp;S. Second C&amp;S manufacturing releases a lot of CO2 in the process, whereas wood itself is literally carbon. In general the build process itself saves around 60% of the carbon against C&amp;S and in theory Wood itself can ‘store’ a little over 400% of the carbon that can be stored from the air. So these ‘tree factories’ in a sense are the most efficient form of carbon capture.</p><p>The vast majority of wood used now for construction is coming from sustainably managed forests. These forests are all made and maintained with minimal to no damage to actual forests. Wood is only called timber when it is made into planks or some kind of structural element.</p><h2 id="process">Process</h2><p>Since wood is much lighter it can be built in part, whole sections at a time completely in the factory and just assembled in place. Even the wood to timber process is now largely automated.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mO01K88.jpg" alt="PreBuilt"></p><p><strong>CLT</strong>: When wood is taken and cross laminated (CL Timber) then it is very resilient to forces in approximately all directions and most so in directions directly normal to the flat surface, making it ideal for walls. The perpendicular grain in alternate layers makes it sturdy in a whole plane at once. Overall making CLT consumes only 50% of that of making concrete and 1% of that of steel.</p><p><strong>GluLam</strong>: Glue Laminated Timber is when 2 layers of wood are placed slightly displaced from each other, like a brick layer is slightly displaced. Every alternate layer directly matches up. This makes it incredibly resilient in one direction, making it suitable for columns and beams.</p><p>Due to its extremely light weight, pound for pound the wood can be made to be much more resilient than C&amp;S. While still dwarfed by the largest of the buildings, wood ones have already reached an regular build height of 75m each. Some stadiums and bridges have also started being built entirely out of wood.</p><h2 id="safety">Safety</h2><h3 id="fire">Fire</h3><p>Timber now can be made to burn much more predictably as opposed to C&amp;S, Steel starts bending in astronomical proportions &amp; contrete starts spalling as opposed to timber which now burns much less and only chars. This allows it to be extremely safe within the fire safety window. Timber can be made to controlably burn for 60-90 minutes before it structurally collapses. The argument is that if someone is not out of the building before this time even in a C&amp;S building, then well…</p><p>Timber buildings can also be fit with sacrificial layers (plasterboard sheets) with allow the core strength bearing structures to be safe. Some of these layers are engineered to burn as slow as 1 mm/min. Some of these materials are even themselves retardants preventing the spread along the surface. It is in fact even possible to make a building such that the fire does not spread and eventually due to a lack of fuel, is no longer strong enough to break the structure so just dies out.</p><h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3><p>CLT can be made to be as dry as less than 12% water which effectively kills of any bugs and fungus inside. While this is still not 100% safety since trees have genetically evolved to strongly interface symbiotically with fungi, strong progress is being made in the direction to prevent timber from doing so. As</p><h2 id="limits">Limits</h2><p>In countries like Sweden (1994) in the western EU they have already removed the upper limit on the height of the building as long as it can meet the basic building requirements of safety and structural integrity. While we have not yet come close to crossing 150m build (defn of a true skyscraper), it seems that it should very likely be possible, C&amp;S being reserved only for the Uber-tall buildings.</p><p>Japanese firm Sumimoto forestery in fact has already promised to build a 350m (~70 floors) building 90% out of wood by 2041 where other than some reinforcement beams, no other concrete or steel has been used.</p>
