        <h1 id="the-killer-whale">The Killer Whale</h1><p>Their Orca comes from Latin Orcinis Orca further derived from the God of The Underworld. Orcas are not just the apex predators of the water but also the smartest.</p><ul>
<li>Orcas chase great whites and ram into its sides in packs, this eventually flips over the shark and the orcas hold it down drowning it. They then don’t eat it directly but extract its liver out with surgical precision and consume only that</li>
<li>They even attack sea lions by looking for lone animals in small floating icebergs which they then use their tails to create a giant wave over and slide the animal into water where they then attack and eat it</li>
<li>Orcas even attack schools of fish where they use their blowholes to release bubbles of air which stuns the fish and then they circle around and beat their tails upwards killing the fish en masse.</li>
</ul><p>Orcas hunt in packs of upto 50 and often have been seen innovating new methods of killing.</p><h2 id="language">Language</h2><p>Orcas were at one time land dwellers as can be seen from their fingers in flippers and left over pelvic bones. Orcas are the largest of the Dolphin family and are not actually whales. They are Whale Killers often said the other way round. Their bite force is 131 Megapascals (Great White is 27.5MP) and can leap upto 15 feet into the air. They are also the second fastest swimmers at 35 km/h making them faster than some military ships.</p><p>While db measured differently in water. Orcas often use successive click sounds as short as 1 ms long to echolocate. These can be as loud as 220 db and lets them locate upto 500m away much farther than they can see in the depths of the water in absence of light. Due to echolocation they also have extremely sensitive auditory organs allowing them to listen with extreme precision to the bladder sounds of individual diff kind of fish which they then attack based on favourites. These high pitched clicks are usually directed and long range high pitch.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bsQY72z.png" alt="OrcaCalls"></p><p>Orcas also use low pitch narrow band tones which have lower distance but go out in much more directions. Due to low range it is estimated that these are what they use for private conversations to coordinate attacks. These whistles can often even be in ultrasound range.</p><p>The final type is Pulsed Whistles. These pulsed whistles are calls which go out to many many kms in the ocean for far away. What is more interesting is newborn calves cannot make this sound and use arbitrary high pitched screams. What this means is this language is learned overtime and while we may not be able to translate it represents a form of communication. Scientists are attempting use ML to find correlations and patters.</p><h2 id="cultures">Cultures</h2><p>KWs have been seen to travel in groups and it is estimated that this group behaviour makes them all posses different group identities and group cultures. These groups or “Pods” as they are called also have their own different dialects with varying sound wave patters. Two of the most common types of pods are Resident and Transient.</p><p>Resident Orcas live around coasts and multiple pods often interact with each other, they don’t however necessarily mix. Transient Pods are those which live furthur in and travel much longer distances over time. We know for a fact from analysing different dialects that Transient Pods don’t interact with Resident Pods. Transient pods also have a low more stable pulse which the Resident pods don’t have and in general are a bit quieter. Resident Pods use echolocation a lot more compared to Transient pods.</p><h2 id="murder">Murder</h2><p>A very shocking strategy was seen in killer whales where they often go close to shoreline, start moving in with the incoming wave (during high tide) and as the tide dies down they suddenly appear out of it and intentionally beach themselves. This allows them to grab a sealion which is clumsy on land and transition from water to land, it then wiggles its way sideways and lets the incoming wave lift it and pull it back in.</p><p>KWs calves are trained by their mothers in this technique and they often use seaweed to practice this upon. In any given area only about 50% of whales are actually able to do this technique, a lot of whales never go back due to the trauma of having been completely out of water for a very short while.</p><p>Killer Whales are believed to be the only other species besides humans that can evolve because of their cultures and choices. They are the only other animals that Evolve by Choice.</p><h2 id="brains">Brains</h2><p>Brain size is not linear with intelligence but a much more effective measure is the Encephalization Quotient (EQ) which measures the size relative to the brain. More muscle per body weight allows more mass to be allocated to thinking. Humans have the highest EQ.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zMiGfz3.png" alt="EQ"></p><p>Orca brains are not only large but also more complex they tend to have more folds and wrinkles (Gyrification) than normally seen. More Gyrification per unit volume allows more processessing.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gP5JKi9.png" alt="GI"></p><p>Orca brains have the highest Gyrification of any known species. They also have enlarged insula which is associated with a sense of self and emotion. Orcas with this sense of self are the only few animals which can recognize themselves in the mirror.</p>
