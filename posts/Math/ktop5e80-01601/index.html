        <p>There is more than one ‘infinity’—in fact, there are infinitely-many infinities, each one larger than before! The set of real numbers (numbers that live on the number line) is the first example of a set that is larger than the set of natural numbers—it is ‘uncountably infinite’.</p><p>Gregor Cantor discovered that any infinite set’s power set — the set of all subsets of its elements — has larger cardinality than it does. Every power set itself has a power set, so that cardinal numbers form an infinitely tall tower of infinities. Cantor discovered that natural numbers can’t be put into one-to-one correspondence with the continuum of real numbers. For instance, try to pair 1 with 1.00000… and 2 with 1.00001…, and you’ll have skipped over infinitely many real numbers (like 1.000000001…). You can’t possibly count them all; their cardinality is greater than that of the natural numbers.</p><h2 id="diagonalization-argument">Diagonalization Argument</h2><p>The way this is done is take any set of natural numbers, say even numbers, it is possible to show that there exists a one to one mapping from the Natural numbers to the even numbers. Integers even. This same cannot be done with real numbers, where if all numbers are mapped to some real numbers say
1 → 1.<strong>0</strong>1010100.. <br>
2 → 1.4<strong>1</strong>415965.. <br>
3 → 1.35<strong>8</strong>97934.. <br>
4 → 1.384<strong>6</strong>2643.. <br>
5 → 1.3532<strong>7</strong>950.. <br>
… <br>
n → 1.38841971..</p><p>We can always find a new Real number which is not in the mapping by borrowing one number and changing it in every place from the given set 1.12978n… (for sake of convenience I just added 1). This new number differs from any previous real number and yet does not have any integer mapped to it. The Infinite Set of real numbers is thereby larger than the infinite set of natural numbers and is called “Uncountably Infinite”.</p>
The natural numbers are called the set ℵ

 or

<p>There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.</p>

 i.e The real numbers are the same size as the power set of the natural numbers (Since power set of X has size 2

<h2 id="between-infinities">Between Infinities</h2><p>Consider</p><p>Imagine I have a family of sets, and every two sets in my family are disjoint: they have no elements in common. How big can such a family be? Infinite. Ex. the family of all singletons above: any two singleton sets have nothing in common. This set is also countable: it can very easily and naturally be paired up with the natural numbers. So it’s infinite, but not so large that it beats 𝑁.</p><p>Can we somehow contrive a family of such disjoint sets which has more members, so many that it cannot be paired up with 𝑁? The answer is No. Any such family is countable (“countable” also allows for “finite”).</p>
Notice: Ee didn’t look at some particular family of sets, and wondered if it is of intermediate size. Instead, we defined a certain property of such families – that of having pairwise disjoint members – and then we enquired if perhaps the maximal such family is both uncountable but smaller than 2
<sup>
ℵ

</sup>
. It didn’t work: the biggest such family is merely countable.
<p>Let’s say that two sets are almost disjoint if they only have finitely many (or none) numbers in common. Now, how large can a family be if any two sets in the family are almost disjoint? One simple idea is to consider the family of all finite sets. Any two of its members are almost disjoint – they are both finite, so they certainly have finite intersection! This is also merely countable.</p><p>Can we do better?
There is a family 𝐶 of sets where any two sets in 𝐶 are almost disjoint and 𝐶 is uncountable. Unfortunately, this family 𝐶 is in fact so large that it has the cardinality of the continuum. So once again, the largest family of almost-disjoint sets fails to be of intermediate cardinality.</p><p>Finally, let’s consider one more property of families of sets. How large can a family of sets be, if whenever I pick any two sets in the family, one is contained in the other? Such a family is called a chain or a tower. Instead of considering disjoint or almost-disjoint sets, we’re now doing almost the exact opposite: we want our sets to be the opposite of disjoint, in that one of them is wholly contained in the other.</p><p>Ex. we can consider the following family: <br>
[all naturals, all naturals &gt;0, all naturals &gt; 1, all naturals &gt; 2, …]</p><p>This is an infinite family of sets and, clearly, if you pick any two of them, you’ll find that one is contained in the other. This family is countable. Can we do better? There’s such a tower 𝑇 which has the cardinality of the continuum.</p><p>In the heady days between Cantor’s coming up with the Continuum Hypothesis and Paul Cohen’s magnificent independence proof, people came up with all kinds of fancy families like the ones we just looked at, asking for the magnitudes (or cardinalities) of the largest or smallest family satisfying this or that property.</p>
Sometimes those cardinalities turned out to be ℵ

, and sometimes unknown. This led to diagrams such as the following one:
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApyoeIH.png" alt="InfinityTower"></p><p>After Paul Cohen’s invention of the technique of forcing, people started using forcing to show that those questions are unanswerable, in the sense that certain universes of sets provide one answer and other universes provide another. Ex. Shelah himself proved[4] in 2004 that whether or not 𝔡&lt;𝔞 in this diagram is independent of ZFC.</p><h2 id="malliaris-and-shelah">Malliaris and Shelah</h2><p>Malliaris and Shelah unexpectedly managed to settle the score for the cardinalities 𝔭 and 𝔱 in the diagram above, which we can now (finally!) explain.</p><p>We looked earlier at families of almost-disjoint sets. We can extend this “almost-” idea in other ways: Ex. we can say that a set 𝐴 is “almost contained” in a set 𝐵 if every member of 𝐴 except possibly for finitely many exceptions is a member of 𝐵. Ex. the numbers 1,2,4,8,16,… are almost contained in the even numbers, and the primes are almost contained in the numbers relatively prime to 6.</p><p>A family of sets has a thread if there’s an infinite set that is almost-contained in all the members of the family. For instance, take the set of primes as a thread, and imagine a family of sets where every set contains almost all the primes (it may miss finitely many) and various other numbers. Such a family will have the primes as a thread. A family without a thread we call threadless.</p><p>Now consider the following properties of infinite families of infinite sets:</p><p>Property P: the family is threadless, but whenever you take finitely many sets from the family, those sets have infinite intersection.
Property T: the family is threadless, and it is an “almost-tower”: Whenever you pick two sets in the family, one of them is almost-contained in the other.
We now ask for the smallest possible size of a family with property P, and we call this minimal cardinality p. Similarly the smallest possible cardinality of a family with property T has cardinality t. Those are the same 𝔭 and 𝔱 that appear in the diagram above.</p><p>If anything, many people (including Shelah) expected that 𝔭&lt;𝔱 (It’s easy to see that 𝔭≤𝔱, since a family with property T certainly has property P).</p><p>Hausdorff had already proved that ℵ1≤𝔭. This means that no countable family can have property P, so the least possible cardinality of such a family must be uncountable. Rothberger managed to prove in 1948 that if indeed ℵ1=𝔭 THEN 𝔭=𝔱. Finally Malliaris and Shelah proved that 𝔭=𝔱 unconditionally – regardless of any foundational axiomatic issues.</p><h2 id="read-more">Read More</h2><p><a href="https://quantamagazine.org/how-many-numbers-exist-infinity-proof-moves-math-closer-to-an-answer-20210715/">QuantaMagazine | How many Numbers?</a>
