        <h2 id="bomber-harris">Bomber Harris</h2><p>The British bomber command became serious only after Hitler Bombed Oxford Street (London), but even then their precision bombing strategy was performing poorly and they were being massacred by the Luftwaffe. More than 55% of the bombers would never return. Bomber harris came and turned this around. He gave up on precision bombing and decided to flatten entire cities. He also supported his bombers in every way possible.</p><p>Bomber Harris called this “Worker Dehousing” for him, combatants and non combatants were alike, so he was heavily in favour of attacking even civilian housing. To him this would cripple their manufacturing. Harris massively expands his fleet and orders new Lancaster Bombers which are equipped with newfound ground scanning RADAR and Radio Navigation. He has a huge pool of volunteers willing to build a very large fleet. Then in ‘42 even American joins the war and places some of their B17 Flying Fortresses in Britain. The allied Air fleet is now unstoppable.</p><h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2><p>On 24th July 1943 germany’s largest city Hamburg is hit. 60% of residential area is destroyed and 43K people are killed. Goebels in Germany calls for the civilians to join the strategy in what they call “Total War”. The attack is downplayed in the press not only in germany (where it needs to be) but even in Britain (for fear of revolt). Churchill who is shocked at the attack asks the press to report it only as Military bombing and not city bombing.</p><p>While bombing like this would demoralise any country, so is not the case with Germany because of Hitler’s black and white view of either a 1000 Year Reich or Armageddon. After DDay on order of Churchill this bombing temporarily stops since the ground invasion now looks like the most promising route. Operation Thunderclap of bombing even larger inner cities is Shelved. Harris who called D Day a “Small Boating Expedition” waits for his turn. The same year the Allied Ground war grinds to a halt in Ardennes and Battle of Bulge takes place killing 90,000 Allies.</p><p>The Soviets who were pushing on non stop from after Battle of Stalingrad now start suffering in millions. Stalin calls FDR and Churchill at Yalta conf in Crimea and asks for support since it looks like Soviets are the only ones even fighting. The Allies who don’t have much ground or sea support left decide to use their Superior Bomber command and revive Operation Thunderclap to attack inner Eastern German cities.</p><h2 id="take-off">Take Off</h2><p>13 Feb 1945 a stream of bombers take off from UK, fly into France, Belgium and then into German RADAR. The Allies throw the Germans off their scent by using a technique called the window where they shower down strips of aluminium which hides what is behind the chaff on RADAR. Early morning at 9, dwindled from constant fighting even the Luftwaffe fails to respond to this raid and doesnt arrive.</p><p>After coming out of chaff cover the allies arrive at the city of dresden, who are just finishing carnival celebrations for the day. Dresden is a cultural city layered with centuries old architechture and did not expect to be attacked so the city was more or less normal. Dresden was often called the Florence of the Elbe. Stories of Dresden were so rampant that people even estimated that it would be the western capital of the new world. Dresden even has slim to no defences, most guns have been moved to east and and no one is watching the skies.</p><p>Rather than going for rail lines and transport hubs, 244 Lancasters empty out all their bombs within 15 minutes attacking the marketplace. Very large block buster bombs and 200,000 cluster incendiaries are designed extremely carefully to get inside buildings and start fires. These tightly packed streets of wooden buildings start feeding into each other and the subtle wind on that day provides the fires with plenty oxygen to burn.</p><p>The RAF taking a page from the Luftwaffe’s book goes in with a 2nd wave about 60-90 mins later just enough for the fire fighters to get out from putting out the first round of flames and 500 bombers rain fire again. A fire like this is a called a Firestorm. It creates a whirlwind of hot air which rapidly rises up and is enough to uproot trees and lift up people and pull them into the fire therefore feeding itself even more. Within a few hours the Americans arrive with their precision bombing idea. But the whole city has a cloud of smoke above it so they also engage in a round 3 of area bombing.</p><p>The news all around the world next day despite such terror is short and to the point</p><blockquote>
<p>Dresden No longer Exists.</p>
</blockquote><h2 id="the-german-side">The German Side</h2><p>Goebbels next day does nothing to suppress the news and lets the press wreck havoc. He spins the news from Nazi Failure to Allied Cruelty taking advantage of the massive CIVILIAN death toll by adding a 0 to it.</p><p>If you were on the streets you would just fly off. If you were in an underground celler for protection as was advised to be, you will be cooked alive. If you were to open the door to any building, the wind would suck you in and you will be again burnt alive. If you go to any open area, the whole city was so hot that you would boil alive.</p><p>Population of Dresden 1939 - 650K. Population of Dresden 1946 400K. It takes 7 hours the main rescue team to reach the city’s main bunker. When they open it they find only rotting smell and green liquid till knee length along with some bones. All 1000 people inside have simply melted. The allies take the bait and the Americans &amp; British start blaming each other. After Dresden, Churchill sent a memo to stop all Area Bombing. After Dresden, Bomber Command and Bomber Harris are entities no one wants to be remotely associated with. Otherwise how are we different from those who are doing the Holocaust? The victory of the allies in WW2 was so complete that the Germans now became the victims.</p><h2 id="coda">Coda</h2><p>न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो
यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः।</p><p>na chaitadvidmaḥ kataranno garīyo
yadvā jayema yadi vā no jayeyuḥ</p><p>I can scarcely say which will be better, that we should conquer them or that they should conquer us</p><p>Bhagwad Gita 2.6</p>
