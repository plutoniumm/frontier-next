        <p>The largest naval gathering EVER in history. With ships carrying 408 planes and 16000 men. Starts off in a top secret mission for 4000 miles in the Pacific.</p><h2 id="japan-prepares">Japan Prepares</h2><p>In 1905 when the Tsarist Empire of Russia is defeated in the East by the tiny island of Japan. They enter the world stage as a formidable world power. Even in WW1 when imperial when imperial German forces started moving into China Japan and healthier lives dry them out in there for win the war for which later they started asking for recognition. As one of 5 countries invited to the Paris Conf they asked for a racial equality clause.</p><p>This clause which asked for things like freer migration to the western countries was rejected and later made worse by the American ban of any non-whites moving to america. An event they termed there the “Yellow Peril”. In the 30s when America was undergoing the great depression the consequences of that reached even Japan who by now had transformed the Feudal system into a Parliamentary Democracy. Japan now on its knees and tightly closed off from the western countries is not very happy.</p><p>A man named Hideki Tojo looks at the whole world from a military angle and asks a question: Why is Indonesia under Dutch Control, South East Asia under French Control, Singapore-Malaya &amp; Honk Kong under British Control and the Philippines under American control. Asia should be for the Asians. So the Japanese attack and take over ALL of Chinese Manchuria. The western powers objected to this and Japan was not happy since if the west can have territory in Asia so can Japan. Furious furthur they enter more of China. Reports of what was happing in Nanking horrify the entire world.</p><h3 id="america-digression">America Digression</h3><p>While Japan was invading China, the west problems of its own, Hitler was taking Europe by force in with rapid expansionist policies. Winston Churchill was convinced that they could not win this war without America entering the war. 1940 was a time of election for America and Franklin D Roosevelt playing his card smartly promised the American parents that their son is not going for war. But secretly even he was concerned that the War in Europe might just not be limited to it.</p><p>FDR wants to make sure he does everything to keep Japan in line so while he cannot actively participate in the war he does everything falling short of just actually firing shots. He starts providing Britain with rapid aid such a ships, military equipment and other economics. He also starts doing manurers in the Pacific which makes them make sure the Japan does not actually enter the War, so in a routine exercise to the Hawaiian islands for the Navy rather than just sending the ships to do the exercise and coming back. In a slight difference of judgement FDR decides to keep the ships is there, at Pearl Harbour.</p><p>There is no other navy around there for thousands of miles. This loaded american gun is a danger to Japan because America has now effectively extended their coastline 1000s of miles out.</p><h2 id="japan-enters">Japan Enters</h2><p>Japan now taking advantage of the instability in Europe signs a pact with Hitler and Mussolini for them to all support each other’s imperialist ideas despite vehement opposition from their very own Navy Admiral Yamamoto. With Paris fallen to the Nazis, Japan takes over the then French occupied Vietnam. This is a big blow to the west and Japan applies a strict embargo against Japan which will be removed IF AND ONLY IF they undo all their expansions till now. Japan who got 80% of their oil from America was now beyond murderously angry.</p><p>Japan’s Prime Minister resigns and Tojo is put in charge of country. Tojo knows any war effort to the USA means going through their Navy which means also taking help from Admiral Yamamoto. Yamamoto looking at the winds decided to attack and rather than smaller nations suggested it was best to go straight for the jugular of the west and take them out on the first day before they expand any more south. The decide to attack the Full United States Pacific Fleet now stationed at. Pearl Harbour.</p><h2 id="attack">Attack</h2><p>Admiral Yamamoto decided to take all his aircraft carriers and 450 planes which at that time was the largest naval air gathering ever. The whole journey was 12 days and they could have been spotted at any of those 12 days. What made the task most difficult was that they had to refuel at sea, and America knew they were coming. Due to intercepts from Japan the americans sent intel to the pacific bases to warn for war giving rise to the most famous sentence from the Pearl Harbour war ever</p><blockquote>
<p>This dispatch is to be considered a War Warning.</p>
</blockquote><p>General Short who was the local army chief decided to ask all the planes to come to the main runway since he was sure that the attack would come from Hawaiian citizens itself most of whom were Japanese. So the planes are now on tarmac and can be guided openly. Radar then was a very new operation and Hawaii had only 1 of it. The two operators of the northern part of the island were told its only for practice.</p><p>On Sunday morning when the two operators called down to HQ to report that 183 airplanes were incoming they were told its most likely routine practice coming from mainland. In a few minutes every single defence aircraft has been taken out since they were already sitting on the open tarmac like sitting ducks. All airfields are taken out. Finally the cream of it all. The battleship rows. The unsinkable navy, was within minutes burning to the ground. Now since planes are gone and guns are gone, the Americans cannot even fight back, they are just spectators watching their own destruction.</p><p>Pearl Harbour was thought to be immune to torpedoes since most of the water was only 40-45 feet deep. But the Americans who undermined Japanese engineering were in for a surprise. The Japanese were able to make small changes like adding wooden fins to the torpedo which allowed them to absorb all initial impact and therefore run in shallow waters. Finally one lucky torpedo hits the core of the USS Arizona lifting the whole ship out of water and instantly killing 1100 people. Making the total of that day to 2403 US servicemen.</p><h2 id="expansion">Expansion</h2><p>With the Pacific fleet in ruins within 24 hours Japan takes over Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and starts expanding furthur south. Soon they would take over The Dutch Indonesia getting access to much needed oil.</p><p>Yamamoto however was very depressed by this attack since for him his cherry prize the Air Craft carriers were spared since they by chance happened to be out of dock that Morning. So while their Destroyers were gone. If the AirCraft carriers are seen as the fundamental units of the Navy (which they often are). Then the Pearl Harbour bombings which looked and were devastating, had done nothing to weaken the United States.</p><p>From a political standpoint this is a gift to FDR since it now means any roadblocks in the way of fighting the Axis powers have now been removed. The very next day in the morning he declares War. Within a week Hitler declares War on the United States. Within less than a month half of all destroyers from pearl harbour are back in service eventually all (but 3) to be. FDR authorizes the bombing of tokyo with the very aircraft carriers the Japanese spared.</p><p>This however meant that unlike the way Japanese anticipated. The Americans were galvanized. And would have been so even if the carriers were lost. Winston Churchill knew that <em>now, the Americans are in the War</em> which means with their stupendous economic and industrial might, the Allies will now win the war. He later even claims that as he went to bed that night he thought to himself</p><blockquote>
<p>So we had won afterall.</p>
</blockquote><p>As the full military might of America is unleashed. The War has just started.</p>
