        <p>When hitler starts moving into Western Europe after taking Norway. Churchill becomes prime minister and immediately sends 150,000 soldiers from the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) against a lot of resistance from his own govt. Hitler meanwhile is having a small disagreement from his generals on how to actually attack France.</p><p>A stowaway plane meanwhile crash lands in a region near belgium which is found by allies and it contains hitler’s secret plans of invading Europe. He intends to take Belgium, Holland and then finally France. Finding his plans discovered he decides to send only a smaller flank to belgium and take the much riskier route and actually rip through Ardennes through Manstein’s doctrine executed by Heinz Guderian. Or as they called it “Bewegungskrieg” known to us as the “Blitzkrieg”.</p><h2 id="the-order">The Order</h2><p>Churchill orders a very large chunk of the Army effectively to not surrender to buy valuable time in Dunkirk for them to escape. The message read “The Empire’s eyes are upon you”. Commander Nicholson on reading this knew it meant it was a fight to death. Churchill later also said that sending that message made him sick to the stomach because it was effectively a suicide order.</p><p>Cmdr Nicholson would later be captured as a prisoner of war where he would later kill himself.</p><p><strong>I Will skip the complex politics. Watch Gary Oldman’s “The Darkest Hour”</strong></p><h2 id="planning">Planning</h2><p>Churchill calls in General Bertram Ramsey to plan the evacuation of Dunkirk since he knew leaving half a million men to die is almost ending the war right away.</p><blockquote>
<p>I want to emphasize just how much 400,000 is</p>
</blockquote><p>This is Glastonbury Pyramid Stage with around 150-200,000 people.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tt3aqA2.jpg" alt="Glastonbury"></p><p>This is burning man 2014 with 70,000 people
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aKhu5Im.jpg" alt="BM"></p><p>Dunkirk beach ground area is about 2-2.5 times that of Glastonbury. Dunkirk is not an accurate representation of that one bit. Atonement comes much closer. Actual dunkirk had kms of lines of people and barely enough room to walk around. I respect Nolan’s wish to not use CGI, but unfortunately there weren’t like 100-200 people on the beach. There were more than 1000 times that.</p><h2 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h2><p>At the end of the first day the Royal Navy are able to do barely 7500 people. Bare in mind that evacuating such a large number of people is not a small task. Its as much as a small city, something we are bad at doing even today and these are military men expressly trained to be optimum.</p><p>When the Germans are heading fast they are told to stop to wait for infantry to catch up with the Panzers. Hitler’s old party comrade right hand man Hermann Goering sees this as a golden opportunity. He was a WWI fighter pilot and was asked to abandon at the last moment despite being filled with National Pride and had been waiting for a good opportunity to do something. He had so far built up the Luftwaffe and also a lot of indulgences such as food and morphine. His morphine even got him admitted to a Psych Hospital twice.</p><p>His delusions therefore gave him a grandiose sense of self worth so he asked hitler in this golden opportunity to let the Luftwaffe bomb the BEF out of existence and not wait for the army. Luftwaffe proceeds to bomb 1/3rd of the whole city of dunkirk out of existence and the port is destroyed. They start attacking the ships and even the soldiers who start building contempt towards the RAF asking questions repeatedly “Where is the RAF”.</p><p><strong>Back and Forth</strong>: With the ports destroyed getting to the large ships is actually a big challenge since they can’t dock in the sand. So the british govt starts broadcasting on radios, intertwines it with movie reels, calls up docks and tries to get any civilian (boat &gt;30ft) to help out. Lightoller was one such man who had volunteered after a very tumultuous life. He was one the most senior member from the Titanic to survive (2nd officer) and was also a commanding officer in WW1. His boat Sundowner was recently commissioned by the Royal Navy but as he would have it he said he takes it or it doesn’t go. So He, His son and a crewman took the Sundowner across the English Channel.</p><h3 id="raf">RAF</h3><p>As resentment towards them grew little did the Soldiers know that they the RAF were actually hard at work and just in the first day over 250 sorties were done. Most fighting was done either above the cloud cover or far away from the beach head in both cases taking the battle away from the soldiers. (This however doesn’t give nolan an excuse to show a grand total of 3 planes. There were more than 50 roaming around at any given time)</p><h2 id="tenant">Tenant</h2><p>After 2-3 days Ramsey’s equivalent on the Dunkirk side arrives and find a glimmer of hope. A Breakwater Mole. A very large tract of bridge used to break water which is not supposed to be used. He makes the ship dock to the side of these breakwaters and starts putting soldiers on ship via those. Soldiers then noticed that they had over 85,000 vehicles lying around the beach which are not used and are left behind, they then decide to string up a bunch of such lorries together and start building a pier out of it in a straight line into the water. They then throw sandbags on it, wooden planks and start using it like a makeshift breakwater pier.</p><p>Dunkirk beach was not just suspense and terror. Since there was no water to go around people started drinking wine and getting heavily drunk. All the while there was also circus performance, people dancing around with monkeys, people performing tricks, people playing cricket and so on and so forth. It was not just bad: people were tense, people were happy, people or having fun, people were fighting, people were basically being people in every possible way as will happen with half a million people.</p><p>There are still unmentioned countless soldiers just outside Dunkirk defending the last line down to the last man standing. The whole 25 mile corridor is a brazen act of selflessness.</p><h2 id="end">End</h2><p>Sundowner meanwhile learns a trick from his Air Force son that watch the Stuka and just at the right moment veer into a turn violently and the bomb will miss. He was able to bring back 130 people on a boat which could carry 25. Well he did learn something from Titanic didn’t he.</p><p>By the end of 1st June the bombing is so painful that Tenant decides to do the remaining of the evacuation at night. 24 hours later Tenant and his colleague run across the whole length of the dunkirk beach with a microphone in their hand screaming “Anyone Left? Anyone Left?” Not one voice came. Every time dick and harry had been picked up and taken back.</p><p>The Miracle of Dunkirk was made possible by Hitler’s Halt order, The Bad Weather, The bravery of the Royal Navy, The RAF, the men who held the last line, the civilians and of course the Soldiers Themselves.</p><p>These people absolutely defeated and demoralized go back to England hoping to be treated with hostility but instead are almost always treated like heroes despite most not having fired a single shot. People give them food, coffee, tea, alcohol etc wherever they can. This was the birth of the true dunkirk spirit. Great Britain is Still in the War.</p>
