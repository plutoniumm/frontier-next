			<p> This is just a compilation of me writing down all the data I accumulate over time. The amount of
				information I receive per day is too high to just remember. This will also help me refine my data
				sources and topics over time
			</p>

			<p>I will also not cite most things or mention the source so should you choose to use the data look it up
				yourself. Frontier is not made for public use and is for me only, it just happens to be more convenient
				to me if it is publicly hosted. So if you get in trouble for any data you use from here, it is YOUR
				problem and yours only, I take no responsibility.
			</p>

			<h4>Disclaimers</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>I don't update the data over time it is possible it gets outdated</li>
				<li>I also don't double fact check the source, it is possible data is
					false/inaccurate/outdated/misconstrued
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>It is possible that you don't agree with something in my notes, in which case. I don't care. As mentioned
				before, It's not meant for you.
			</p>

			<h3>Note: </h3>
			<p>This is NOT a blog. Being a blog implies original content. This is not original, most of the stuff here
				is ripped off. These are notes meant to organise my information.
			</p>

			<p>If any images or video is owned by/licensed to you and you want it to be taken down or have the credit
				included please let me know I'll do it, with NO EXCEPTIONS.
			</p>

			<h4>Note on Features</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="fw5">There will be no TTS.</span>Use your own local reader like Siri or something.
					There is no point in shipping extremely heavy code marginally better than what your system already
					has inbuilt. <kbd>Right click</kbd> and <kbd>Speech</kbd></li>
